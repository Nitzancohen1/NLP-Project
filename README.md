# NLP-project

The project aims to investigate the possibility of predicting whether a tweet from Twitter refers to a real disaster or not. 
In the project we studied 2 datasets of tweets in an attempt to predict whether certain characteristics of the tweet, 
such as an unusually high number of likes or whether the user is verified, can improve the ability to predict whether a tweet is related to a real disaster or not.
